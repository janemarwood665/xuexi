I like sports like football。 Many people asked me why I love this sport。 I always smile to say because I love work together to run。 Everyone in the stadium sweat together to greet the unity victory in the course of joy。 Everyone laughing is a good thing。 We meet together victory in the arena of friendship。 We laugh loudly echoed in this piece of green。 Friendship in this game gradually built up。 I will never give up never fail。 This is I learned at the football field。 Everyone together for the game and ready to。 Victory laugh together failed to continue the effort to look like is to unite the beautiful。 We have a special figure and laugh the most special field always。 We put their arms around each other happily run youth friendship as pure as。 I can't stop I would run in the youth on the road。 Even if injured， still have to climb up。 I am not afraid of difficulties。 I'm afraid I am only a man on the run。
